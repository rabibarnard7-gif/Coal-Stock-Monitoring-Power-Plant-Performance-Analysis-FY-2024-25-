⚡️ Coal Stock Monitoring & Power Plant Performance Analysis-FY 2024-25 🏭

Tools: 📊 Dashboard Analysis | 📈 Data Interpretation | 🔬 Power Sector Metrics

A detailed analysis of two key operational dashboards for Indian thermal power plants: Coal Stock Monitoring and Supply and Plant Performance Analysis, covering the fiscal year 2024-2025 (April 1, 2024, to March 3, 2025).

📌 Project Overview
This dashboard analysis provides a consolidated view of the power sector's operational health, critical for ensuring stable electricity generation. The project aims to help stakeholders understand:
•	Logistics & Supply: 🚂 Performance of transportation modes (Sea, Rail, Road) and Pithead power plants.
•	Inventory Health: 📦 Total requirement, receipts, shortages, and average stock days across different sectors and states.
•	Plant Efficiency: 🎯 Monthly and sector-wise Plant Load Factor (PLF), highlighting the performance differential between Critical and Subcritical units.

❓ Problem Statement
The Indian power sector faces challenges in maintaining optimal coal inventory and high plant efficiency. We need a unified analytical view to address:
•	Supply Chain Gaps: Quantifying the efficiency of coal logistics and identifying shortages.
•	Operational Risk: Tracking stock levels, especially for Critical Plants (21 identified plants), to mitigate shutdowns.
•	Performance Disparity: Analyzing the wide performance gap between Critical and Subcritical plants through the Plant Load Factor (PLF).

📝 Key Dashboard Metrics & Observations

I. Coal Stock Monitoring Dashboard 📦

Metric Name	Value	💡 Insight
Power Stations	190	Total units monitored.
Total Requirement	980.45K	Demand (in Th Tonnes).
Coal Shortage	166.34K	⚠️ Supply gap (Requirement minus Receipt).
Average Stock Days	22.56	Acceptable average inventory duration.
Critical Plants	21	High-risk plants requiring immediate attention.
Subcritical Plants	189	Standard operation units.
•	Stock Days by Sector:
o	Joint Venture, Private, State, and Central Sectors all maintain a similar average stock days of $\approx 20-25$ days.
•	Capacity by State:
o	Uttar Pradesh (8.6M) and Maharashtra (8.0M) hold the highest total capacity, making them crucial states for stock stability.

II. Supply and Plant Performance Analysis Dashboard 🚂

Metric Name	Value	Unit	📊 Data Point
Rail	489.98K	Th Tonnes	Primary Transport Mode (Highest Volume).
Sea	44.92K	Th Tonnes	Secondary coastal supply.
Pithead	188.02K	Th Tonnes	Stock for close-proximity plants.
Total Stock	14.96M	Th Tonnes	Overall coal inventory.
Average PLF %	48.70%	%	Overall plant efficiency (needs improvement).

•	Indigenous Stock Trend (Quarterly - Sum of Actual):

o	Q1: 2.9M
o	Q2: 4.0M 🚀 (Highest receipt quarter)
o	Q3: 3.5M
o	Q4: 3.1M
•	Plant Load Factor (PLF) by Critical vs. Subcritical:
o	Subcritical Plants: Show more stability and consistently higher PLF throughout most of the year (e.g., Jan 62%, Feb 64%).
o	Critical Plants: Exhibit dangerous volatility, including a sharp drop to -51% in March and very low figures in April, indicating major operational breakdowns or downtime.

📊 Performance Summary

⚙️ Key Findings

•	Logistics: 🚂 Rail dominates the coal supply chain, responsible for nearly 500K Th Tonnes, emphasizing its strategic role.
•	Inventory Risk:
o	A significant shortage of 166.34K Th Tonnes exists between requirement and receipt.
o	21 plants are officially categorized as Critical (low stock).
•	Operational Efficiency:
o	The overall Average PLF is low at 48.70%.
o	Critical Plants show erratic and extremely low performance in the fiscal year's beginning (April) and end (March), dragging down the national average.
•	Geographic Focus: 📍 States like Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra must be prioritized due to their massive power generation capacity (over 8M Th Tonnes each).

📘 Conclusion

The analysis confirms that the power sector faces dual challenges: persistent coal supply constraints (166.34K shortage) and severe operational instability in Critical plants. While Subcritical units show steady performance, the volatility of the 21 Critical plants significantly depresses the overall PLF.
•	Action Required: Future strategy must focus on optimizing Rail logistics and urgent operational stabilization of the Critical plants to ensure the national power grid remains secure and efficient.
